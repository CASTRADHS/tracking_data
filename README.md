# Tracking_data 

The raw datasets collected from the mobile device using CASTRA Tracking App is uploaded as a Zip file. 

See the paper "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308188584_A_multi-faceted_approach_to_user_authentication_for_mobile_devices_-_Using_human_movement_usage_and_location_patterns" that talks about applying ML on datasets to learn various user patterns; The datasets were used to learn the models described in the paper. 

The datasets consists of sensor data as well as Gogle Play API that labels the  data with the type of the activity performed by user (WALKING, STILL with confidence thresholds)
